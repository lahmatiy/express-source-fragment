Express middleware to get a file content fragment by request to defined route. Based on [source-fragment](https://github.com/lahmatiy/source-fragment).

## Install

```
npm install express-source-fragment
```

## Usage

```js
var express = require('express');
var sourceFragment = require('express-source-fragment');

var app = express();

// There are few ways to setup:
// - to trigger middleware on *GET* request to `/source-fragment`
app.get('/source-fragment', sourceFragment());

// - to trigger middleware on *any* request method to `/source-fragment`
app.use('/source-fragment', sourceFragment());

// - to trigger middleware on *any* request method to *any* path
//   (not recomended unless server's single purpose is to open files in editor)
app.use(sourceFragment());
```

After that you can use `GET` requests like `/source-fragment?file=foo/bar.js:2:5:4:12` to get source fragment `foo/bar.js` that starts from line 2 column 5 and ends on line 4 column 12.

### Using with webpack-dev-server

Although `webpack-dev-server` uses `express` to create a server, you have the same options to apply the middleware to it. The only difference is that you should define it in `setup` method (see [issue](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/285) for details).

```js
var server = new WebpackDevServer(webpack(config), {
  // ...
  setup: function(app) {
    app.use('/source-fragment', sourceFragment());
  }
});
```

## API

```
sourceFragment([options]);
```

Options:

- `cwd`

  Type: `String`  
  Default: `''` (uses `process.cwd()`)

  Working directory used when resolving paths.
